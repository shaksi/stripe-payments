           We are running a new 7 day trial programme where you can try the IQOS experience in the comfort of your own home, obligation free. <br><br>

              We are so confident you will enjoy the experience that we will not charge you anything until the end of the trial period. At which point if you decide to return the device you will only have to pay for the HEETS tobacco sticks (£22.50). <br><br>

              If like us you relish the experience and decide to keep it. You will only pay £74 in total and thats including the HEETS (RRP £136.50)<br><br>

              To get started confirm you're over 18, select preferred device colour and tell us the delivery details. We will get your trial package to you the next day. <br><br>
